### About the Project  
The **"We need to do it perfectly well"** project explores the theme of perfectionism in work and study. Despite its visually simple layout, it includes several technical nuances.  

---

### Project Structure  ✨

**HTML:**  
Inside `<body>`, there should be only two elements: `<video>` and `<h1>`

**CSS:**  
- Global `box-sizing: border-box;` for all elements and pseudo-elements.  
- `body` stretches to 100% of the screen height, inheriting from `<html>`.  
- `video` plays automatically, loops, is muted, and has no controls.  
- `object-fit: cover;` and `object-position: center;` for the video.  

### Pseudo-Element Features  ✨
- A veil overlay on `body`.  
- A star next to `h1`.  
- A tooltip appearing on `h1` hover.  
- `\A` with `white-space: pre;` for text breaks in `content`.  

### Code Validation  ✨
- HTML/CSS validator  
- Prettier  
- Auto Close Tag
